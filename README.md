# Talk to Agent üó£Ô∏è

This is a web application that allows users to have a real-time voice conversation with a virtual agent. It captures microphone input, sends it to a backend for processing, and plays back the agent's audio response, complete with dynamic audio visualizations.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: The app intelligently detects when you've finished speaking and automatically sends your message.
* **Live Audio Visualization**: See your voice visualized in real-time as you speak.
* **Audio Replay & Visualization**: Real-time waveform is displayed during recording using `wavesurfer.js`, giving user valuable feedback.
* **State Management**: Built with a scalable Redux Toolkit setup for predictable state management.
* **Modern Frontend**: A responsive and clean interface built with Next.js and React.
